# Summary

Bexhoma (Benchmark Experiment Host Manager) is a Python tool that helps with managing benchmark experiments of Database Management Systems (DBMS) in a Kubernetes-based High-Performance-Computing (HPC) cluster environment. It enables users to configure hardware / software setups for easily repeating tests over varying configurations.

It serves as the orchestrator [@10.1007/978-3-030-94437-7_6] for distributed parallel benchmarking experiments in a Kubernetes Cloud. This has been tested at Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and at Minikube installations, running with Clickhouse, Exasol, Citus Data (Hyperscale), IBM DB2, MariaDB, MariaDB Columnstore, MemSQL (SingleStore), MonetDB, MySQL, OmniSci (HEAVY.AI), Oracle DB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SAP HANA, TimescaleDB, and Vertica.

See the [homepage](https://github.com/Beuth-Erdelt/Benchmark-Experiment-Host-Manager) and the [documentation](https://bexhoma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details.
