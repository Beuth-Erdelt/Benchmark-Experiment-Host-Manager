# Workload C: Read only
#   Application example: user profile cache, where profiles are constructed elsewhere (e.g., Hadoop)
#                        
#   Read/update ratio: 100/0
#   Default data size: 1 KB records (10 fields, 100 bytes each, plus key)
#   Request distribution: uniform
#
#
#
#
#
# Same as workload C, but uniform distribution
