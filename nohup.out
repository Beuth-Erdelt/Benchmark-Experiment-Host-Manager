Experiment                    : This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of YCSB queries. YCSB is performed using several threads and processes. Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL']. YCSB data is loaded using several processes. Benchmark is limited to DBMS PostgreSQL. Loading is fixed to cl-worker19. Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.

Experiment                    : This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of TPC-H queries in different DBMS. System metrics are monitored by sidecar containers. TPC-H (SF=1) data is loaded and benchmark is executed. Query ordering is Q1 - Q22. All instances use the same query parameters. Import sets indexes and constraints after loading and recomputes statistics. Import is handled by 8 processes (pods). Loading is fixed to cl-worker19. Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.

### Workload
    YCSB SF=1
    This includes no queries. YCSB runs the benchmark
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of YCSB queries. YCSB is performed using several threads and processes. Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL']. YCSB data is loaded using several processes. Benchmark is limited to DBMS PostgreSQL. Loading is fixed to cl-worker19. Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.

### Workload
    YCSB SF=1
    This includes no queries. YCSB runs the benchmark
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of YCSB queries. YCSB is performed using several threads and processes. Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL']. YCSB data is loaded using several processes. Benchmark is limited to DBMS PostgreSQL. Loading is fixed to cl-worker19. Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
