### Workload
TPC-H Queries SF=1
    Type: tpch
    Duration: 1316s 
    Code: 1743612001
    This includes the reading queries of TPC-H.
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of TPC-H queries in different DBMS.
    TPC-H (SF=1) data is loaded and benchmark is executed.
    Query ordering is Q1 - Q22.
    All instances use the same query parameters.
    Timeout per query is 1200.
    Import sets indexes and constraints after loading and recomputes statistics.
    Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['Citus'].
    Import is handled by 8 processes (pods).
    Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
    Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
    SUT is fixed to cl-worker23.
    Loading is tested with [1] threads, split into [8] pods.
    Benchmarking is tested with [1] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
    Experiment is run once.
