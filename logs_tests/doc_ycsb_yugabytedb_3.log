Experiment                    : This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of YCSB queries.
Workload is 'A'. Number of rows to insert is 1000000. Number of operations is 10000000. Batch size is ''.
YCSB is performed using several threads and processes. Target is based on multiples of '16384'. Factors for loading are [4]. Factors for benchmarking are [4].
System metrics are monitored by a cluster-wide installation.
Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['YugabyteDB'].
Import is handled by 8 processes (pods).
Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
Database is persisted to disk of type shared and size 1Gi.
Loading is tested with [64] threads, split into [8] pods.
Benchmarking is tested with [64] threads, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
Experiment is run once.
