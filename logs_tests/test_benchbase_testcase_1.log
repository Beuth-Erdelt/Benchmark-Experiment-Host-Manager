Experiment                    : This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of Benchbase queries in different DBMS.
Benchbase data is generated and loaded using several threads.
Benchmark is 'tpcc'. Scaling factor (e.g., number of warehouses) is 16. Benchmarking runs for 300 minutes.
Benchmark is limited to DBMS PostgreSQL.
Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19. SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
Loading is tested with [1] threads and [1] target factors of base 1024, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is tested with [16] threads and [8] target factors of base 1024, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
Experiment is run once.

### Workload
    Benchbase Workload SF=16 (warehouses for TPC-C)
    This includes no queries. Benchbase runs the benchmark
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of Benchbase queries in different DBMS.
Benchbase data is generated and loaded using several threads.
Benchmark is 'tpcc'. Scaling factor (e.g., number of warehouses) is 16. Benchmarking runs for 300 minutes.
Benchmark is limited to DBMS PostgreSQL.
Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19. SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
Loading is tested with [1] threads and [1] target factors of base 1024, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is tested with [16] threads and [8] target factors of base 1024, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
Experiment is run once.
