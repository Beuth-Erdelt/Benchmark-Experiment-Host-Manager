    Type: benchbase
    Duration: 1084s 
    Code: 1751847760
    Intro: Benchbase runs a TPC-C experiment.
    This imports a Benchbase data set.
    Benchbase data is generated and loaded using several threads. Scaling factor is 10. Target is based on multiples of '65536'.
    Experiment uses bexhoma version 0.8.9.
    System metrics are monitored by a cluster-wide installation.
    Experiment is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL'].
    Import is handled by 1 processes (pods).
    Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
    Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
    SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
    Database is persisted to disk of type shared and size 200Gi.
    Loading is tested with [100] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Number of tenants is 10, one schema per tenant.
    Experiment is run once.
