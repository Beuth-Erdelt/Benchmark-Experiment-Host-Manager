### Workload
Benchbase Workload tpcc SF=1
    Type: benchbase
    Duration: 1193s 
    Code: 1758637514
    Intro: Benchbase runs a TPC-C experiment.
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of Benchbase queries in different DBMS.
    Benchbase data is generated and loaded using several threads.
    Benchmark is 'tpcc'. Scaling factor is 1. Target is based on multiples of '1024'. Factors for benchmarking are [1]. Benchmarking has keying and thinking times activated. Benchmarking runs for 5 minutes.
    Experiment uses bexhoma version 0.8.12.
    Experiment is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL'].
    Import is handled by 1 processes (pods).
    Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
    Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
    SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
    Loading is tested with [1] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is tested with [10] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is run as [2, 2] times the number of benchmarking pods.
    Number of tenants is 2, one schema per tenant.
    Experiment is run once.
