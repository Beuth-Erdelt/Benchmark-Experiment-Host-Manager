Experiment                    : This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of TPC-H queries in different DBMS.
TPC-H (SF=1) data is loaded and benchmark is executed.
Query ordering is Q1 - Q22.
All instances use the same query parameters.
Timeout per query is 1200.
Import sets indexes and constraints after loading and recomputes statistics.
Experiment uses bexhoma version 0.8.7.
Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['MySQL'].
Import is handled by 8 processes (pods).
Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
Loading is tested with [1] threads, split into [8] pods.
Benchmarking is tested with [1] threads, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
Experiment is run once.
