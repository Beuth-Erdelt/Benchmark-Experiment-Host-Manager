## Show Summary

### Workload
    Benchbase Workload SF=16 (warehouses for TPC-C)
    Type: dbmsbenchmarker
    Duration: 965s 
    This includes no queries. Benchbase runs the benchmark
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of Benchbase queries in different DBMS.
Benchbase data is generated and loaded using several threads.
Benchmark is 'tpcc'. Scaling factor (e.g., number of warehouses) is 16. Benchmarking runs for 5 minutes. Target is based on multiples of '1024'. Factors for benchmarking are [16].
Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL'].
Import is handled by 1 processes (pods).
Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
Loading is tested with [1] threads, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is tested with [16] threads, split into [1, 2] pods.
Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
Experiment is run once.
