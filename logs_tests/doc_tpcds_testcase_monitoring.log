Experiment                    : This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of TPC-DS queries in different DBMS.
TPC-DS (SF=3) data is loaded and benchmark is executed.
Query ordering is Q1 - Q99.
All instances use the same query parameters.
Timeout per query is 600.
Import sets indexes and constraints after loading and recomputes statistics.
System metrics are monitored by a cluster-wide installation.
Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['MonetDB'].
Import is handled by 8 processes (pods).
Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
Loading is tested with [8] threads, split into [8] pods.
Benchmarking is tested with [1] threads, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
Experiment is run once.
