Experiment uses bexhoma version 0.8.7.
System metrics are monitored by a cluster-wide installation.
Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['Redis'].
Import is handled by 8 processes (pods).
Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
Loading is tested with [64] threads, split into [8] pods.
Benchmarking is tested with [128] threads, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
