Experiment                    : This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of TPC-C queries in different DBMS.
System metrics are monitored by a cluster-wide installation.
TPC-C data is generated and loaded using several threads.
Scaling factor (i.e., number of warehouses) is 16. Benchmarking runs for 5 minutes.
Benchmark is limited to DBMS PostgreSQL.
Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
Database is persisted to disk of type shared and size 30Gi.
Loading is tested with [8] threads, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is tested with [16] threads, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
Experiment is run once.
