Experiment                    : This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of TPC-C queries in different DBMS.
TPC-C data is generated and loaded using several threads.
Scaling factor (i.e., number of warehouses) is 16. Benchmarking runs for 5 minutes.
System metrics are monitored by a cluster-wide installation.
Benchmark is limited to DBMS P, o, s, t, g, r, e, S, Q, L.
Import is handled by 1 processes (pods).
Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
Database is persisted to disk of type shared and size 30Gi.
Loading is tested with [8] threads, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is tested with [16] threads, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
Experiment is run once.
