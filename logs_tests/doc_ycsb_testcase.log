Experiment                    : This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of YCSB queries.
YCSB is performed using several threads and processes.
Workload is 'A'. Number of rows to insert is 1000000. Number of operations is 1000000.
Benchmark is limited to DBMS PostgreSQL.
Loading is tested with [64] threads and [1, 4] target factors of base 16384, split into [1, 8] pods.
Benchmarking is tested with [64] threads and [2, 3] target factors of base 16384, split into [1, 8] pods.
Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
Experiment is run once.
