### Workload
Benchbase Workload tpcc SF=1
    Type: benchbase
    Duration: 685s 
    Code: 1749557610
    Intro: Benchbase runs a TPC-C experiment.
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of Benchbase queries in different DBMS.
    Benchbase data is generated and loaded using several threads.
    Benchmark is 'tpcc'. Scaling factor is 1. Target is based on multiples of '1024'. Factors for benchmarking are [1]. Benchmarking runs for 5 minutes.
    Experiment uses bexhoma version 0.8.7.
    System metrics are monitored by a cluster-wide installation.
    Experiment is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL'].
    Import is handled by 1 processes (pods).
    Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
    Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
    SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
    Loading is tested with [64] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is tested with [64] threads, split into [8] pods.
    Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
    Experiment is run once.
