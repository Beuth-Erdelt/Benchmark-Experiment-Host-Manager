### Workload
YCSB SF=10
    Type: ycsb
    Duration: 1797s 
    Code: 1747319890
    YCSB tool runs the benchmark.
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of YCSB queries.
    Workload is 'D'.
    Number of rows to insert is 10000000.
    Ordering of inserts is hashed.
    Number of operations is 10000000.
    Batch size is ''.
    Target is based on multiples of '16384'.
    Factors for loading are [4].
    Factors for benchmarking are [4].
    Experiment uses bexhoma version 0.8.5.
    System metrics are monitored by a cluster-wide installation.
    Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL'].
    Import is handled by 8 processes (pods).
    Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
    Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
    SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
    Loading is tested with [64] threads, split into [8] pods.
    Benchmarking is tested with [64] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
    Experiment is run once.
