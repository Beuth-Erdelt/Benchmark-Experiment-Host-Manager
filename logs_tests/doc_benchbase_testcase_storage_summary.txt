### Workload
Benchbase Workload SF=16
    Type: benchbase
    Duration: 1221s 
    Code: 1747668595
    Benchbase runs the TPC-C benchmark.
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of Benchbase queries in different DBMS.
    Benchbase data is generated and loaded using several threads.
    Benchmark is 'tpcc'. Scaling factor is 16. Benchmarking runs for 5 minutes. Target is based on multiples of '1024'. Factors for benchmarking are [16].
    Experiment uses bexhoma version 0.8.5.
    Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL'].
    Import is handled by 1 processes (pods).
    Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
    Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
    SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
    Database is persisted to disk of type shared and size 30Gi.
    Loading is tested with [1] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is tested with [16] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
    Experiment is run 2 times.
