### Workload
HammerDB Workload SF=1 (warehouses for TPC-C)
    Type: tpcc
    Duration: 798s 
    Code: 1749558955
    HammerDB runs the benchmark.
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of TPC-C queries in different DBMS.
    TPC-C data is generated and loaded using several threads.
    Scaling factor (i.e., number of warehouses) is 1. Benchmarking runs for 5 minutes.
    Experiment uses bexhoma version 0.8.7.
    System metrics are monitored by a cluster-wide installation.
    Experiment is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL'].
    Import is handled by 1 processes (pods).
    Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
    Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
    SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
    Loading is tested with [1] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is tested with [64] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
    Experiment is run once.
