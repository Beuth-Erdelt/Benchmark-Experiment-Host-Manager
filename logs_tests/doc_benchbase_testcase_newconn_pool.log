Experiment                    : This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of Benchbase queries in different DBMS.
Benchbase data is generated and loaded using several threads.
Benchmark is 'tpcc'. Scaling factor is 16. Benchmarking runs for 10 minutes. Target is based on multiples of '1024'. Factors for benchmarking are [16]. There is a reconnect for each transaction.
Experiment uses bexhoma version 0.8.4.
Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['PGBouncer'].
Import is handled by 1 processes (pods).
Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
Loading is tested with [1] threads, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is tested with [32] threads, split into [1, 2] pods.
Pooling is done with [2] pods having [32] inbound and [32] outbound connections in total.
Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
Experiment is run once.
