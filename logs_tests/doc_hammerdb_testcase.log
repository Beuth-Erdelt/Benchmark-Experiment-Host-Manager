Experiment                    : starts at 2024-09-12 20:39:42.389943 (902322.513924426)
Experiment                    : This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of TPC-C queries in different DBMS.
TPC-C data is generated and loaded using several threads.
Scaling factor (i.e., number of warehouses) is 16. Benchmarking runs for 5 minutes.
Benchmark is limited to DBMS PostgreSQL.
Loading is tested with [16] threads, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is tested with [8] threads, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
Experiment is run once.
