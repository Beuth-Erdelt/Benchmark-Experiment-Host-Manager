### Workload
HammerDB Workload SF=16 (warehouses for TPC-C)
    Type: tpcc
    Duration: 1331s 
    Code: 1743789575
    HammerDB runs the benchmark.
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of TPC-C queries in different DBMS.
    TPC-C data is generated and loaded using several threads.
    Scaling factor (i.e., number of warehouses) is 16. Benchmarking runs for 5 minutes.
    Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL'].
    Import is handled by 1 processes (pods).
    Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
    Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
    SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
    Loading is tested with [16] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is tested with [16] threads, split into [1, 2] pods.
    Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
    Experiment is run once.
