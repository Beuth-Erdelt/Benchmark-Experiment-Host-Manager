### Workload
YCSB SF=16
    Type: ycsb
    Duration: 2537s 
    Code: 1745066294
    YCSB tool runs the benchmark.
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of YCSB queries.
    Workload is 'C'.
    Number of rows to insert is 16000000.
    Number of operations is 16000000.
    Batch size is ''.
    Target is based on multiples of '16384'.
    Factors for loading are [11].
    Factors for benchmarking are [11].
    Experiment uses bexhoma version 0.8.4.
    System metrics are monitored by a cluster-wide installation.
    Benchmark is limited to DBMS ['PGBouncer'].
    Import is handled by 16 processes (pods).
    Loading is fixed to cl-worker13.
    Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker13.
    SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
    Database is persisted to disk of type shared and size 100Gi.
    Loading is tested with [64] threads, split into [16] pods.
    Benchmarking is tested with [128] threads, split into [16] pods.
    Pooling is done with [4] pods having [128] inbound and [64] outbound connections in total.
    Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
    Experiment is run 2 times.
