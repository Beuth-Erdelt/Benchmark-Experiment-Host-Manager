### Workload
HammerDB Workload SF=16 (warehouses for TPC-C)
    Type: tpcc
    Duration: 770s 
    Code: 1728367624
    This includes no queries. HammerDB runs the benchmark
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of TPC-C queries in different DBMS.
    TPC-C data is generated and loaded using several threads.
    Scaling factor (i.e., number of warehouses) is 16. Benchmarking runs for 5 minutes.
    Benchmark is limited to DBMS PostgreSQL.
    Import is handled by 1 processes (pods).
    Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
    Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
    SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
    Loading is tested with [8] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is tested with [16] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
    Experiment is run once.
