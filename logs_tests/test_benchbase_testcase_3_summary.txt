### Workload
    Benchbase Workload SF=16 (warehouses for TPC-C)
    This includes no queries. Benchbase runs the benchmark
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of Benchbase queries in different DBMS.
System metrics are monitored by a cluster-wide installation.
Benchbase data is generated and loaded using several threads.
Benchmark is 'tpcc'. Scaling factor (e.g., number of warehouses) is 16. Benchmarking runs for 5 minutes.
Benchmark is limited to DBMS PostgreSQL.
Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19. SUT is fixed to cl-worker11.
Loading is tested with [1] threads and [1] target factors of base 1024, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is tested with [16] threads and [8] target factors of base 1024, split into [1] pods.
Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
Experiment is run once.
