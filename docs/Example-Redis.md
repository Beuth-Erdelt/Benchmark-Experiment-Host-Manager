# Example: Benchmark Redis

This differs from the default behaviour of bexhoma, since we benchmark **a distributed NoSQL DBMS, that can be managed by bexhoma** and exists in the Kubernetes cluster in the same namespace.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beuth-Erdelt/Benchmark-Experiment-Host-Manager/master/docs/workflow-sketch-simple.png"/>

Redis is a Key / Value store [1].
There is a single-host and a cluster version.
In the cluster version, there are several pods deployed for the worker nodes using a stateful set.
Each shard and each replication needs it's own pod.
Redis cluster does not require a coordinator.
Bexhoma still deploys a main pod (called master) as a substitute for a single point of contact and to annotate status of experiments.
Bexhoma also deploys a service for communication external to Redis (from within the cluster) and a headless service for communication between the pods of the Redis cluster.
See [dummy manifest](https://github.com/Beuth-Erdelt/Benchmark-Experiment-Host-Manager/blob/master/k8s/deploymenttemplate-Redis.yml) for a single-host version that is suitable for bexhoma and see [dummy manifest](https://github.com/Beuth-Erdelt/Benchmark-Experiment-Host-Manager/blob/master/k8s/deploymenttemplate-RedisCluster.yml) for a multi-host version that is suitable for bexhoma.

This can be managed by bexhoma.


**The results are not official benchmark results.
Exact performance depends on a number of parameters.
You may get different results.
These examples are solely to illustrate how to use bexhoma and show the result evaluation.**

## Perform YCSB Benchmark - Ingestion of Data Included

You will have to change the node selectors there (to names of nodes, that exist in your cluster - or to leave out the corresponding parameters):
```bash
BEXHOMA_NODE_SUT="cl-worker11"
BEXHOMA_NODE_LOAD="cl-worker19"
BEXHOMA_NODE_BENCHMARK="cl-worker19"
LOG_DIR="./logs_tests"

mkdir -p $LOG_DIR
```

For performing the experiment we can run the [ycsb file](https://github.com/Beuth-Erdelt/Benchmark-Experiment-Host-Manager/blob/master/ycsb.py).

Example: 
```bash
nohup python ycsb.py -ms 1 -tr \
  -sf 1 \
  -sfo 10 \
  --workload a \
  -dbms Redis \
  -rnn $BEXHOMA_NODE_SUT -rnl $BEXHOMA_NODE_LOAD -rnb $BEXHOMA_NODE_BENCHMARK \
  -tb 16384 \
  -nlp 8 \
  -nlt 64 \
  -nlf 12 \
  -nbp 1 \
  -nbt 128 \
  -nbf 4 \
  -ne 1 \
  -nc 1 \
  -m -mc \
  run </dev/null &>$LOG_DIR/doc_ycsb_redis_1.log &
```

This
* loops over `n` in [8] and `t` in [12]
  * starts a clean instance of Redis (`-dbms`)
    * data directory inside a Docker container
  * creates YCSB schema in each database
  * starts `n` loader pods per DBMS
    * with a loading container each
      * threads = 64/`n` (`-nlt`)
      * target throughput is `t` * 16384
      * generates YCSB data = 1.000.000 rows (i.e., SF=1, `-sf`)
      * imports it into the DBMS
  * loops over `m` in [1] and `s` in [4]
    * runs `m` parallel streams of YCSB queries per DBMS
      * 10.000.000 operations (i.e., SF=10, `-sfo`)
      * workload A = 50% read / 50% write (`--workload`)
      * target throughput is `s` * 16384
      * threads = 64/`m` (`-nbt`)
    * with a maximum of 1 DBMS per time (`-ms`)
* tests if results match workflow (`-tr`)
* monitors (`-m`) all components (`-mc`)
* shows a summary

### Status

You can watch the status while benchmark is running via `bexperiments status`

```
Dashboard: Running
Cluster Prometheus: Running
Message Queue: Running
Data directory: Running
Result directory: Running
+-------------------+--------------+------------+------------------------+
| 1741876409        | sut          | use case   | loading                |

| Redis-64-8-196608 | (1. Running) | ycsb       | (7 Running)(1 Pending) |
+-------------------+--------------+------------+------------------------+
```

The code `1730133803` is the unique identifier of the experiment.
You can find the number also in the output of `ycsb.py`.

### Cleanup

The script is supposed to clean up and remove everything from the cluster that is related to the experiment after finishing.
If something goes wrong, you can also clean up manually with `bexperiment stop` (removes everything) or `bexperiment stop -e 1730133803` (removes everything that is related to experiment `1730133803`).

To see the summary again you can simply call `bexperiments summary -e 1730133803` with the experiment code.

### Detailed Evaluation

Results are transformed into pandas DataFrames and can be inspected in detail.
See for example
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/Beuth-Erdelt/Benchmark-Experiment-Host-Manager/tree/master/images/evaluator_dbmsbenchmarker/notebooks/)

You can connect to an evaluation server locally by `bexperiments jupyter`.
This forwards ports, so you have
* a Jupyter notebook server at http://localhost:8888




## Monitoring

[Monitoring](Monitoring.html) can be activated for DBMS only (`-m`) or for all components (`-mc`).

All metrics in monitoring are summed across all matching components.
In the following example, this means that used memory, CPU time, etc. are summed across all 3 nodes of the Redis cluster.


## Distributed DBMS

If you want to deploy Redis as a cluster, you can adjust the number of workers `-nw` when calling the script:
```
nohup python ycsb.py -ms 1 -tr \
  -sf 1 \
  -sfo 10 \
  -nw 3 \
  --workload a \
  -dbms Redis \
  -rnn $BEXHOMA_NODE_SUT -rnl $BEXHOMA_NODE_LOAD -rnb $BEXHOMA_NODE_BENCHMARK \
  -tb 16384 \
  -nlp 8 \
  -nlt 64 \
  -nlf 12 \
  -nbp 1 \
  -nbt 128 \
  -nbf 4 \
  -ne 1 \
  -nc 1 \
  -m -mc \
  run </dev/null &>$LOG_DIR/doc_ycsb_redis_2.log &
```

yields something like

## Replication

We can set the number of replicas with the parameter `-nwr`.
Note that Redis requires a worker per replicated shard, so `-nw 3` and `-nwr 1` creates 6 worker nodes, 3 for sharding and another 3 for the (single) replicas.

```
nohup python ycsb.py -ms 1 -tr \
  -sf 1 \
  -sfo 10 \
  -nw 3 \

## Use Persistent Storage

The default behaviour of bexhoma is that the database is stored inside the ephemeral storage of the Docker container.
If your cluster allows dynamic provisioning of volumes, you might request a persistent storage of a certain type (storageClass) and size.
**Currently this only works for single-host experiments, as provisioning for stateful-sets works differently.**

Example:
```bash
nohup python ycsb.py -ms 1 -tr \
  -sf 1 \
  -sfo 10 \
  --workload a \
  -dbms Redis \
  -rnn $BEXHOMA_NODE_SUT -rnl $BEXHOMA_NODE_LOAD -rnb $BEXHOMA_NODE_BENCHMARK \
  -tb 16384 \
  -nlp 8 \
  -nlt 64 \
  -nlf 12 \
  -nbp 1 \
  -nbt 128 \
  -nbf 4 \
  -ne 1 \
  -nc 2 \
  -m -mc \
  -rst shared -rss 50Gi \
  run </dev/null &>$LOG_DIR/doc_ycsb_redis_4.log &
```

The following status shows we have one volume of type `shared`.
Every single-host Redis experiment running YCSB of SF=1 will take the databases from these volumes and skip loading.
In this example `-nc` is set to two, that is the complete experiment is repeated twice for statistical confidence.
The first instance of Redis mounts the volume and generates the data.
All other instances just use the database without generating and loading data.

```
+----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------------+--------------+-------------------+-----------------+----------------------+-----------+----------+--------+--------+
| Volumes                                | configuration   | experiment   | loaded [s]   |   timeLoading [s] | dbms            | storage_class_name   | storage   | status   | size   | used   |
+========================================+=================+==============+==============+===================+=================+======================+===========+==========+========+========+
| bexhoma-storage-redis-ycsb-1           | redis           | ycsb-1       | True         |                50 | Redis           | shared               | 50Gi      | Bound    | 50G    | 0      |
+----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------------+--------------+-------------------+-----------------+----------------------+-----------+----------+--------+--------+
```

## YCSB Example Explained


### Configuration of Bexhoma

In `cluster.config` there is a section:

```
'Redis': {
    'loadData': 'redis-cli < {scriptname}',
    'delay_prepare': 0,
    'attachWorker': '',
    'template': {
        'version': 'xxx',
        'alias': 'Key-Value-1',
        'docker_alias': 'KV1',
        'auth': ["root", ""],
    },
    'logfile': '/var/log/redis/redis-server.log',
    'datadir': '/data',
    'priceperhourdollar': 0.0,
},
```

Notice how this does not have a JDBC section (as Redis does not support this).
