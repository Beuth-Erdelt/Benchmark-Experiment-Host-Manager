# Benchmark: Benchbase's TPC-C

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beuth-Erdelt/Benchmark-Experiment-Host-Manager/master/docs/workflow-sketch-simple.png"/>

Benchbase's TPC-C [1] implementation [2,5] does not allow scaling data generation and ingestion, but scaling the benchmarking driver.
It uses quite some resources, so that for simulating a lot of users, scale-out of the driver is necessary [6].

> TPC-C involves a mix of five concurrent transactions of different types and complexity either executed on-line or queued for deferred execution. The database is comprised of nine types of tables with a wide range of record and population sizes. TPC-C is measured in transactions per minute (tpmC). While the benchmark portrays the activity of a wholesale supplier, TPC-C is not limited to the activity of any particular business segment, but, rather represents any industry that must manage, sell, or distribute a product or service.

In Benchbase's implementation, for each warehouse the number of assigned threads is computed [3].
Each thread receives a fixed warehouse and a fixed number of districts and starts a connection [4].
There still can be deadlocks, because *A supplying warehouse number (OL_SUPPLY_W_ID) is selected as the home warehouse 99% of the time and as a remote warehouse 1% of the time* [1], and a new order sets a lock at the stock table.

**The results are not official benchmark results.
Exact performance depends on a number of parameters.
You may get different results.
These examples are solely to illustrate how to use bexhoma and show the result evaluation.**

## Perform Benchmark

You will have to change the node selectors there (to names of nodes, that exist in your cluster - or to leave out the corresponding parameters):
```bash
BEXHOMA_NODE_SUT="cl-worker11"
BEXHOMA_NODE_LOAD="cl-worker19"
BEXHOMA_NODE_BENCHMARK="cl-worker19"
LOG_DIR="./logs_tests"

mkdir -p $LOG_DIR
```

For performing the experiment we can run the [benchbase file](https://github.com/Beuth-Erdelt/Benchmark-Experiment-Host-Manager/blob/master/benchbase.py).

Example:
```bash
nohup python benchbase.py -ms 1 -tr \
  -sf 16 \
  -sd 5 \
  -dbms PostgreSQL \
  -nbp 1,2 \
  -nbt 160 \
  -nbf 16 \
  -tb 1024 \
  -rnn $BEXHOMA_NODE_SUT -rnl $BEXHOMA_NODE_LOAD -rnb $BEXHOMA_NODE_BENCHMARK \
  run </dev/null &>$LOG_DIR/doc_benchbase_testcase_scale.log &
```

This
* starts a clean instance of PostgreSQL (`-dbms`)
  * data directory inside a Docker container
* starts 1 loader pod (per DBMS) that
  * creates TPC-C schema in the database
  * imports data for 16 (`-sf`) warehouses into the DBMS
  * using all threads of driver machine (benchbase setting)
* runs streams of TPC-C queries (per DBMS)
    * running for 5 (`-sd`) minutes
    * each stream (pod) having 16 threads to simulate 16 users (`-nbt`)
    * `-nbp`: first stream 1 pod, second stream 2 pods (8 threads each)
    * target is 16x(`-ltf`) 1024 (`-tb`) ops
* with a maximum of 1 DBMS per time (`-ms`)
* tests if results match workflow (`-tr`)
* shows a summary

### Status

You can watch the status while benchmark is running via `bexperiments status`

```bash
Dashboard: Running
Cluster Prometheus: Running
Message Queue: Running
Data directory: Running
Result directory: Running
+---------------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+-----------------------------+
| 1726658756          | sut          |   loaded [s] | use case       | benchmarker                 |
+=====================+==============+==============+================+=============================+
| PostgreSQL-1-1-1024 | (1. Running) |           62 | benchbase_tpcc | (2. Succeeded) (2. Running) |
+---------------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+-----------------------------+
```

The code `1726658756` is the unique identifier of the experiment.
You can find the number also in the output of `benchbase.py`.

### Cleanup

The script is supposed to clean up and remove everything from the cluster that is related to the experiment after finishing.
If something goes wrong, you can also clean up manually with `bexperiment stop` (removes everything) or `bexperiment stop -e 1726658756` (removes everything that is related to experiment `1726658756`).

    Code: 1769434910
    Intro: Benchbase runs a TPC-C experiment.
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of Benchbase queries in different DBMS.
    Benchbase data is generated and loaded using several threads.
    Benchmark is 'tpcc'. Scaling factor is 16. Target is based on multiples of '1024'. Factors for benchmarking are [16]. Benchmarking runs for 5 minutes.
    Experiment uses bexhoma version 0.8.20.
    Experiment is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL'].
    Import is handled by 1 processes (pods).
    Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
    Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
    SUT is fixed to cl-worker14.
    Loading is tested with [1] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is tested with [160] threads, split into [1, 2] pods.
    Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
    Experiment is run once.

### Workflow

#### Actual
DBMS PostgreSQL-1-1-1024 - Pods [[2, 1]]

#### Planned
DBMS PostgreSQL-1-1-1024 - Pods [[1, 2]]

### Loading
                       time_load  terminals  pods  Throughput [SF/h]
PostgreSQL-1-1-1024-1      259.0        1.0   1.0         222.393822
PostgreSQL-1-1-1024-2      259.0        1.0   2.0         222.393822

### Tests
TEST passed: Throughput (requests/second) contains no 0 or NaN
TEST passed: Workflow as planned
```

We can see that the overall throughput is close to the target and that scaled-out drivers (2 pods with 8 threads each) have similar results as a monolithic driver (1 pod with 16 threads).

To see the summary again you can simply call `bexperiments summary -e 1708411664` with the experiment code.

### Detailed Evaluation

Results are transformed into pandas DataFrames and can be inspected in detail.
See for example
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/Beuth-Erdelt/Benchmark-Experiment-Host-Manager/tree/master/images/evaluator_dbmsbenchmarker/notebooks/)

You can connect to an evaluation server in the cluster by `bexperiments dashboard`.
This forwards ports, so you have
* a Jupyter notebook server at http://localhost:8888

You can connect to an evaluation server locally by `bexperiments jupyter`.
This forwards ports, so you have
* a Jupyter notebook server at http://localhost:8888

## Adjust Parameters

The script supports
* exact repetitions for statistical confidence
* variations to scan a large parameters space
* combine results for easy evaluation

There are various ways to change parameters.

### Manifests

The YAML manifests for the components can be found in https://github.com/Beuth-Erdelt/Benchmark-Experiment-Host-Manager/tree/master/k8s

### SQL Scrips

The SQL scripts for pre and post ingestion can be found in https://github.com/Beuth-Erdelt/Benchmark-Experiment-Host-Manager/tree/master/experiments/benchbase

## Monitoring

[Monitoring](Monitoring.html) can be activated for DBMS only (`-m`) or for all components (`-mc`).

Example:

```bash
nohup python benchbase.py -ms 1 -tr \
  -sf 16 \
  -sd 5 \
  -dbms PostgreSQL \
  -nbp 1,2 \
  -nbt 160 \
  -nbf 16 \
  -tb 1024 \
  -m -mc \
  -rnn $BEXHOMA_NODE_SUT -rnl $BEXHOMA_NODE_LOAD -rnb $BEXHOMA_NODE_BENCHMARK \
  run </dev/null &>$LOG_DIR/doc_benchbase_testcase_monitoring.log &
```

The result looks something like

### Workload
Benchbase Workload tpcc SF=16
    Type: benchbase
    Duration: 1251s 
    Code: 1769436110
    Intro: Benchbase runs a TPC-C experiment.
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of Benchbase queries in different DBMS.
    Benchbase data is generated and loaded using several threads.
    Benchmark is 'tpcc'. Scaling factor is 16. Target is based on multiples of '1024'. Factors for benchmarking are [16]. Benchmarking runs for 5 minutes.
    Experiment uses bexhoma version 0.8.20.
    System metrics are monitored by a cluster-wide installation.
    Experiment is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL'].
    Import is handled by 1 processes (pods).
    Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
    Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
    SUT is fixed to cl-worker14.
    Loading is tested with [1] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is tested with [160] threads, split into [1, 2] pods.
    Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
    Experiment is run once.

```

This gives a survey about CPU (in CPU seconds) and RAM usage (in Gb) during loading and execution of the benchmark.

In this example, metrics are very instable. Metrics are fetched every 30 seconds.
This is too coarse for such a quick example.


## Use Persistent Storage

The default behaviour of bexhoma is that the database is stored inside the ephemeral storage of the Docker container.
If your cluster allows dynamic provisioning of volumes, you might request a persistent storage of a certain type (storageClass) and size.

Example:
```bash
nohup python benchbase.py -ms 1 -tr \
  -sf 16 \
  -sd 5 \
  -dbms PostgreSQL \
  -nbp 1 \
  -nbt 160 \
  -nbf 16 \
  -tb 1024 \
  -nc 2 \
  -rst shared -rss 50Gi \
  -rnn $BEXHOMA_NODE_SUT -rnl $BEXHOMA_NODE_LOAD -rnb $BEXHOMA_NODE_BENCHMARK \
  run </dev/null &>$LOG_DIR/doc_benchbase_testcase_storage.log &
```

The following status shows we have two volumes of type `shared`.
Every PostgreSQL experiment running Benchbase's TPC-C of SF=16 (warehouses) will take the databases from these volumes and skip loading.
In this example `-nc` is set to two, that is the complete experiment is repeated twice for statistical confidence.
The first instance of PostgreSQL mounts the volume and generates the data.
All other instances just use the database without generating and loading data.

```bash
+----------------------------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+--------------+-------------------+-----------------+----------------------+-----------+----------+--------+--------+
| Volumes                                      | configuration   | experiment        | loaded [s]   |   timeLoading [s] | dbms            | storage_class_name   | storage   | status   | size   | used   |
+==============================================+=================+===================+==============+===================+=================+======================+===========+==========+========+========+
| bexhoma-storage-postgresql-benchbase-tpcc-16 | postgresql      | benchbase-tpcc-16 | True         |               184 | PostgreSQL      | shared               | 50Gi      | Bound    | 50G    | 4.8G   |

### Tests
TEST passed: Throughput (requests/second) contains no 0 or NaN
TEST passed: Workflow as planned
```

The loading times for both instances of loading are the same, since both relate to the same process of ingesting into the database.
Note the added section about `volume_size` and `volume_used` in the connections section.
Also note the size increases from first to second run (benchmark writes data).

## Keying and Thinking Time

We can activate waiting times before and after execution of transactions with `-xkey` to follow TPC-C specifications more closely.
Also also make sure, the number of driver threads (`-nbt`) is 10 times the number of warehouses (`-sf`).

We at first remove persistent storage
```bash
kubectl delete pvc bexhoma-storage-postgresql-benchbase-160
```

```bash
nohup python benchbase.py -ms 1 -tr \

### Workload
Benchbase Workload tpcc SF=160
    Type: benchbase
    Duration: 24880s 
    Code: 1769506893
    Intro: Benchbase runs a TPC-C experiment.
    This experiment compares run time and resource consumption of Benchbase queries in different DBMS.
    Benchbase data is generated and loaded using several threads.
    Benchmark is 'tpcc'. Scaling factor is 160. Target is based on multiples of '1024'. Factors for benchmarking are [1]. Benchmarking has keying and thinking times activated. Benchmarking runs for 30 minutes.
    Experiment uses bexhoma version 0.8.20.
    System metrics are monitored by a cluster-wide installation.
    Experiment is limited to DBMS ['PostgreSQL'].
    Import is handled by 1 processes (pods).
    Loading is fixed to cl-worker19.
    Benchmarking is fixed to cl-worker19.
    SUT is fixed to cl-worker14.
    Database is persisted to disk of type shared and size 100Gi.
    Loading is tested with [1] threads, split into [1] pods.
    Benchmarking is tested with [1600] threads, split into [1, 2, 5, 10] pods.
    Benchmarking is run as [1] times the number of benchmarking pods.
    Experiment is run once.

Now also efficiency is computed via `0.45 * 60. * 100. * Goodput (requests/second) / 12.86 / sf`, when number of client threads is 10 times the number of warehouses:
* 45% is the average portion of new orders in the set of transactions
* 60 transforms to per-minute
* 100 makes it a percentage value
* Goodput (requests/second) is the number of successful transactions per second
* sf is the number of warehouses
* 12.86 is the theoretical limit in the TPC-C speficications

Note that these are statistical values.
